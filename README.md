# EyeWrite - Eye-Tracking Virtual Keyboard

## Project Description:
EyeWrite is a system that enables typing using only eye movements,
designed for people with motor disabilities.
The system uses the computer camera to detect the pupils, maps the gaze position to a virtual keyboard,
and allows typing without any physical contact.
